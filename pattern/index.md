*Introduction:*
  - 8 important patterns for coding interviews split into two categories:
    - *Linear structures:* arrays, linked lists, strings.
    - *Nonlinear structures:* trees, graphs.
  - Focus on pre-built code templates for these patterns.

- *Linear Data Structure Patterns:*
  1. *Two Pointers:*
     - Reduces time complexity to linear time \(O(n)\).
     - Two methods:
       - Same direction: used for scanning data in a single pass (e.g., fast and slow pointers to detect cycles or find middle elements).
       - Opposite directions: used for finding pairs (e.g., sum of two numbers in a sorted array).
  2. *Sliding Window:*
     - Refines two pointers to manage a window of elements dynamically.
     - Expands or contracts the window to meet specific conditions (e.g., longest substring without repeating characters).
     - Often combined with hashmaps.
  3. *Binary Search:*
     - Efficiently finds target in logarithmic time \(O(\log n)\).
     - Extends to lists with monotonic conditions, not just sorted numbers.
     - Example: finding the minimum in a rotated sorted array.

- *Nonlinear Data Structure Patterns:*
  4. *Breadth-First Search (BFS):*
     - Explores nodes level by level.
     - Uses a queue to keep track of visited nodes (ideal for level order traversal).
  5. *Depth-First Search (DFS):*
     - Dives deep into one path before exploring others.
     - Often uses recursion and is memory efficient for exploring all paths.
     - Example: counting islands in a grid.
  6. *Backtracking:*
     - Extension of DFS, explores all possible solutions.
     - Builds the solution dynamically by making decisions and backtracking on invalid paths.
     - Example: letter combinations of a phone number.

- *Heaps (Priority Queue):*
  7. *Heaps:*
     - Used for questions related to top K, K smallest/largest.
     - *Min Heap:* smallest value at the root.
     - *Max Heap:* largest value at the root.
     - Max Heap is used to find K smallest values, and vice versa for K largest.

- *Dynamic Programming (DP):*
  8. *Dynamic Programming:*
     - Optimizes solutions by breaking problems into overlapping subproblems.
     - Two approaches:
       - *Top-down:* recursive with memoization to store results.
       - *Bottom-up:* solves smaller subproblems iteratively using a table.
