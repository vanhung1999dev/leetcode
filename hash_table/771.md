```
You're given strings jewels representing the types of stones that are jewels, and stones representing the stones you have. Each character in stones is a type of stone you have. You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.

Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A".



Example 1:

Input: jewels = "aA", stones = "aAAbbbb"
Output: 3
Example 2:

Input: jewels = "z", stones = "ZZ"
Output: 0


Constraints:

1 <= jewels.length, stones.length <= 50
jewels and stones consist of only English letters.
All the characters of jewels are unique.

- time: O(n)

```
var numJewelsInStones = function(jewels, stones) {
    const hashTable = {};
    let total = stones.length;
    for (let i=0; i< jewels.length; i++) {
        if (!hashTable[jewels[i]]) {
            hashTable[jewels[i]] = 1;
        }
    }

    for (let i=0; i<stones.length; i++) {
        if (!hashTable[stones[i]]) total -= 1;
    }

     return total;
};
